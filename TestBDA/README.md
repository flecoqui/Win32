# TESTBDA and TESTUWPBDA	

TestBDA is a sample Win32 application built with Visual Studio 2015 to using BDA services to use DVB-T Tuner to capture MPTS streams coming from the DVB-T Tuner.
TestUWPBDA is a sample Universal Windows Platform application which tries to use the same BDA services to use DVB-T Tuner to capture MPTS streams coming from the DVB-T Tuner. You'll see that is doesn't work for UWP Applications.
